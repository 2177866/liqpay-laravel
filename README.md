## Requirements

- PHP 8.1+
- Laravel 9+

## Installation
Add the package via Composer:
```shell
composer require alyakin/liqpay-laravel
```

Publishing the configuration:

```shell
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=liqpay-config
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=liqpay-migrations
```

Check the created configuration and migration files, make changes, and then run

```shell
php artisan migrate
```

## Configuration

After publishing, the configuration file `config/liqpay.php` contains:

- `public_key` â€” public key from Liqpay
- `private_key` â€” private key from Liqpay
- `result_url` â€” link for redirecting the user after payment
- `server_url` â€” link for programmatic notification (webhook)

All parameters can be overridden through the `.env` file:

```shell
LIQPAY_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
LIQPAY_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
LIQPAY_RESULT_URL="${APP_URL}/billing"
LIQPAY_SERVER_URL="/api/liqpay/webhook"
```

## Usage

### Generating a payment link

```php
use Alyakin\LiqpayLaravel\Contracts\LiqpayServiceInterface as Liqpay;
use Alyakin\LiqpayLaravel\DTO\LiqpayRequestDto;

$liqpay = app(Liqpay::class);

$url = $liqpay->getPaymentUrl(LiqpayRequestDto::fromArray([
    'version' => 3,
    'public_key' => config('liqpay.public_key'),
    'action' => 'pay',
    'amount' => 100,
    'currency' => 'UAH',
    'description' => 'Payment for order #'.($a = rand(1000,9999)),
    'language' => 'ua',
    'order_id' => 'ORDER-'.$a,
    'result_url' => config('liqpay.result_url'),
    'server_url' => config('app.url').config('liqpay.server_url'),
]));

return redirect($url);
```

### Handling webhook from Liqpay (events)

The package automatically registers the route `/api/liqpay/webhook` (the route from the config) and includes a handler for incoming requests.

When the webhook is triggered, the following events are called:

- `LiqpayWebhookReceived` - occurs when ANY webhook is received from Liqpay

After the general event is triggered, events corresponding to the statuses will be called:

- `LiqpayPaymentFailed` - occurs when payment fails
- `LiqpayPaymentSucceeded` - occurs when payment is successful
- `LiqpayPaymentWaiting` - occurs when payment is pending
- `LiqpayReversed` - occurs when payment is canceled
- `LiqpaySubscribed` - occurs when subscribing to payments
- `LiqpayUnsubscribed` - occurs when unsubscribing from payments

To handle these events in your Laravel application, you can register the corresponding event listeners. Pay special attention to [the package&#39;s behavior in case of errors in event handlers](docs/EVENTS.md).

Example of registering a listener for the `LiqpayPaymentSucceeded` event:

```php
namespace App\Listeners;

use Alyakin\LiqpayLaravel\Events\LiqpayPaymentSucceeded;

class HandleLiqpayPaymentSucceeded
{
    public function handle(LiqpayPaymentSucceeded $event)
    {

        \Log::debug(__method__, $event->dto->toArray());
        // Your code for handling successful payment
    }
}
```

The event has a property `dto`, which is [an object](/src/DTO/LiqpayWebhookDto.php).

You can also enable the built-in event handler `LiqpayWebhookReceived` for logging all incoming webhooks by registering it in `app/Providers/EventServiceProvider.php` in the `boot` method as follows:

```php
Event::listen(
    \Alyakin\LiqpayLaravel\Events\LiqpayWebhookReceived::class,
    \Alyakin\LiqpayLaravel\Listeners\LogLiqpayWebhook::class,
);
```

### ðŸ“¦ Subscription support

The package supports automatic subscription registration via webhook (`action: subscribe`) and deactivation (`status: unsubscribed`).

### ðŸ“¥ Importing subscriptions from the archive

To import and synchronize Liqpay subscriptions in bulk, use the built-in Artisan command:

```shell
php artisan liqpay:sync-subscriptions [--from=YYYY-MM-DD] [--to=YYYY-MM-DD] [--restart]
```

- By default, the command imports the archive for the past month.
- Supports safe resuming: processing progress is saved in cache and can recover from interruptions.
- The `--restart` flag resets progress and restarts the import from scratch.
- Archive processing is memory efficient: CSV is streamed and never fully loaded into memory.

**Example:**
```shell
php artisan liqpay:sync-subscriptions --from=2024-01-01 --to=2024-06-30
```

The archive is downloaded directly from the Liqpay API, and large datasets are handled reliably, even with failures or restarts.

---

**Recommended for initial data loading.**


### ðŸ”§ Managing subscriptions manually

```php
$liqpay->unsubscribe('ORDER-123');
$liqpay->subscribeUpdate(new LiqpaySubscriptionDto(...));
```
